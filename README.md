### Assessment details
Using next js and API available at https://dummyjson.com/docs build a simple Web app that
does following task using Next js (preferred)
1. User login, fetch the email from the response, maintain it in state and make it visible in
the UI for the subsequent requests.
2. List all the product with pagination
3. Show product detail
4. List all the available product categories and list products of category when clicked on a
certain category.
5. Use a pie chart to show product distribution by product categories (Pie chart of product
count per category)
After finishing, share us the github/bitbucket link to the repo along with the instructions to run
the project.
Note: UI is secondary but all the components required to make things work should be present,
However, you get an extra bonus point for paying attention to UI/UX. For CSS tailwind is
preferred.
